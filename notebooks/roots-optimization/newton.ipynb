In particular, we guess a solution $x_0$ of the equation $f(x)=0$, compute the linear approximation of $f(x)$ at $x_0$ and then find the $x$-intercept of the linear approximation."

    "\n",
    "When it converges, Newton's method usually converges very quickly and this is its main advantage. However, Newton's method is not guaranteed to converge and this is obviously a big disadvantage especially compared to the bisection and secant methods which are guaranteed to converge to a solution (provided they start with an interval containing a root).\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method also requires computing values of the derivative of the function in question. This is potentially a disadvantage if the derivative is difficult to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stopping criteria for Newton's method differs from the bisection and secant methods. In those methods, we know how close we are to a solution because we are computing intervals which contain a solution. In Newton's method, we don't know how close we are to a solution. All we can compute is the value $f(x)$ and so we implement a stopping criteria based on $f(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's no guarantee that the method converges to a solution and we should set a maximum number of iterations so that our implementation ends if we don't find a solution."
