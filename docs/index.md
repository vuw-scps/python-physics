(under construction)

## Acknowledgments and further resources

This website is currently a template copied from the [excellent resources at http://www.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/](www.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/) and [the associated notebooks](https://github.com/patrickwalls/mathematical-python); we'll soon be adding our own content with the following topics:
